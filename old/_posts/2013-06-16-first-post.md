Well, then, this is the beginning of my internet presence.

It is hosted on GitHub. I did not realize that one could use GitHub in this way, but a friend of mine, <a href="http://capshaw.me">Andrew Capshaw</a>, explained how to do it. GitHub uses a static page builder,
<a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>,
which is designed for blogs and easy to use.

But now that I've mentioned Andrew's name, I should clarify that he opened the door for me and showed me Jekyll syntax, but he didn't design any of this site.
Indeed, there's no one to blame but me for this website's style, or lack thereof.

I've chosen a nice font, I suppose ("Lato" from the Google Fonts world), and I make some CSS3 media queries so that the site can claim to be usable on screens of all sizes. Hardly Twitter Bootstrap, but it works!

Perhaps soon I'll do something that requires pictures. Then I'll have to figure out how actually to integrate pictures into the layout of this site. That will doubtless give the general design a chance to improve.
