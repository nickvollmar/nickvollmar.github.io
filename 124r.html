Sing then Benedicte and Pater Noster and litanies. Dig up the plant. Let that short knife pierce [it]. Go afterwards as early as you can to the church and lay the plant under the altar with that short knife. Let [it] lie until the sun is up. Wash afterwards. Put [it] into a drink, and bishopwort and lichen from a crucifix. Boil three times in milk. Pour holy water three times on [it]. Sing on [it] Pater Noster and credos and Gloria in Excelsis Deo and sing on it litanies and also write by it with a sword around on four sides on a cross and drink that drink afterwards.
